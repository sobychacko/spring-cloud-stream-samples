=== Samples Acceptance Tests

This is an accptance test module for the samples in this repo.
The tests launch the Spring Cloud Stream samples as stand alone Spring Boot applications and then verify their correctness.

By default, these tests are not run as part of the normal build, as they are mainly intended for continuous integration testing with ongoing changes in the framework.

In order to run the tests, we recommend to run the script `./runAcceptanceTest.sh` in this directory.
The script will launch all the middleware and other components in docker containers first.
Then it builds the applications and run them.
