== What is this app?

This is an example of a Spring Cloud Stream processor using Kafka Streams aggregation support.

*Make the appropriate changes in application.yml if need be.

`spring.cloud.stream.kstream.binder.brokers=<Broker IP Address>` +

Go to the root of the repository and do: `./mvnw clean package`

`java -jar target/kafka-streams-aggregate-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Run the stand-alone `Producers` application a few times to to generate some data.
