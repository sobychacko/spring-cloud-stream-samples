# How do I override the default binding names in Spring Cloud Stream?

## Problem Statement

Spring Cloud Stream creates default bindings based on the function definition and signature, but how do I override these to more domain friendly names?

## Solution

Assume that following is your function signature.

```
@Bean
public Function<KStream<String, Order>, KTable<String, Account>, KStream<String, EnrichedOrder>> processOrder() {
...
}
```

By default, Spring Cloud Stream will create three different binding names for this function.

1. processOrder-in-0
2. processOrder-in-1
3. processOrder-out-0

You have to use these binding names each time you want to set some configuration on these bindings.
You don't like that, and you want to use more domain-friendly and readable binding names, for example, something like.

1. orders
2. accounts
3. enrichedOrders

You can easily do that by simply setting these three properties

1. spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings.processOrder-in-0=orders
2. spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings.processOrder-in-1=accounts
3. spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings.processOrder-out-0=enrichedOrders

Once you do that, it overrides the default binding names and any properties that you want to set on them must be on these new binding names.
