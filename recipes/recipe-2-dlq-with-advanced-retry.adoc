# DLQ with Advanced Retry Options

## Problem Statement

This is similar to recipe-1, but as a developer I would like to configure the way retries are handled.

## Solution

If you followed recipe-1, then you get the default retry options built into the Kafka binder when the processing encounters an error.

By default, the binder retires for a maximum of 3 attempts with 1 second initial delay, 2.0 multiplier with each back off with a max delay of 10 seconds.
You can change all these configurations as below:

```
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.processData-in-0.consumer.maxAtttempts
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.processData-in-0.consumer.backOffInitialInterval
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.processData-in-0.consumer.backOffMultipler
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.processData-in-0.consumer.backOffMaxInterval
```

If you want, you can also provide a list of retryable exceptions by providing a map of boolean values.
For example,

```
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.processData-in-0.consumer.retryableExceptions.java.lang.IllegalStateException=true
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.processData-in-0.consumer.retryableExceptions.java.lang.IllegalArgumentException=false
```

By default, any exceptions not listed in the map above will be retried.
If that is not desired, then you can disable that by providing,

```
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.processData-in-0.consumer.defaultRetryable=false
```

You can also provide your own `RetryTemplate` and mark it as `@StreamRetryTemplate` which will be scanned and used by the binder.
This is useful when you want more sophisticated retry strategies and policies.

If you have multiple such `@StreamRetryTemplate` beans, then you can specify which one your binding wants by using the property,

```
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.processData-in-0.consumer.retry-template-name=<your-retry-template-bean-name>
```
