# How do I manually acknowledge using Kafka binder?

## Problem Statement

Using Kafka binder, I want to manually acknowledge the messages in my consumer.
How do I do that?

## Solution

By default, Kafka binder delegates to the default commit settings in Spring for Apache Kafka project.
The default `ackMode` in Spring Kafka is `batch`.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/current/reference/html/#committing-offsets[here] for more details on that.

There are situations in which you want to disable this default commit behavior and rely on manual commits.
Following steps allow you to do that.

Set the property `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<binding-name>.consumer.ackMode` to either `MANUAL` or `MANUAL_IMMEDIATE`.
When it is set like that, then there will be a header called `kafka_acknowledgment` (from `KafkaHeaders.ACKNOWLEDGMENT`) present in the message received by the consumer method.

For example, imagine this as your consumer method.

```
@Bean
public Consumer<Message<String>> myConsumer() {
    return msg -> {
        Acknowledgment acknowledgment = message.getHeaders().get(KafkaHeaders.ACKNOWLEDGMENT, Acknowledgment.class);
        if (acknowledgment != null) {
         System.out.println("Acknowledgment provided");
         acknowledgment.acknowledge();
        }
    };
}
```

Then you set the property `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.myConsumer-in-0.consumer.ackMode` to `MANUAL` or `MANUAL_IMMEDIATE`.
