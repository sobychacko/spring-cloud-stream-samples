# Basic offset management in Kafka binder

## Problem Statement

I want to write a Spring Cloud Stream Kafka consumer applicaiton and not sure about how it manages Kafka consumer offsets.
Can you exaplain?

## Solution

We encourage you read the docs section on this to get a thorough understanding on it.
https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka/docs/3.1.3-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka.html#reset-offsets

Here is it in a gist:

Kafka supports two types of offsets to start with by default - `earliest` and `latest`.
Their semantics are self-explanatory from their names.

Assuming you are running the consumer for the first time.
If you miss the group.id in your Spring Cloud Stream application, then it becomes an anonymous consumer.
Whenever, you have an anonymous consumer, in that case, Spring Cloud Stream application by default will start from the `latest` available offset in the topic partition.
On the other hand, if you explicitly specify a group.id, then by default, the Spring Cloud Stream application will start from the `earliest` available offset in the topic partiton.

In both cases above (consumers with explicit groups and anonymous groups), the starting offset can be switched around by using the property `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<binding-name>.consumer.startOffset` and setting it to either `earliest` or `latest`.

Now, assume that you already ran the consumer before and now starting it again.
In this case, the starting offset semantics in the above case do not apply as the consumer finds an already committed offset for the consumer group (In the case of an anonymous consumer, although the application does not provide a group.id, the binder will auto generate one for you).
It simply picks up from the last committed offset onward.
This is true, even when you have a `startOffset` value provided.

However, you can override the default behavior where the consumer starts from the last committed offset by using the `resetOffsets` property.
In order to do that, set the property `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<binding-name>.consumer.resetOffsets` to `true` (which is `false` by default).
Then make sure you provide the `startOffset` value (either `earliest` or `latest`).
When you do that and then start the consumer application, each time you start, it starts as if this is starting for the first time and ignore any committed offsets for the partition.
