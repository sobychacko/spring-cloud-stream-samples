# How do I send a message key as part of my record?

## Problem Statement

I need to send a key along with the payload of the record, is there a way to do that in Spring Cloud Stream?

## Solution

It is often necessary that you want to send associative data structure like a map as the record with a key and value.
Spring Cloud Stream allows you to do that in a straightforward manner.
Following is a basic blueprint for doing this, but you may want to adapt it to your paricular use case.

Here is sample producer method (aka `Supplier`).

```
@Bean
public Supplier<Message<String>> supplier() {
    return () -> MessageBuilder.withPayload("foo").setHeader(KafkaHeaders.MESSAGE_KEY, "my-foo").build();
}
```

This is a trivial function that sends a message with a `String` payload, but also with a key.
Note that we set the key as a message header using `KafkaHeaders.MESSAGE_KEY`.

If you want to change the key from the default `kafka_messageKey`, then in the configuration, we need to specify this property:

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.supplier-out-0.producer.messageKeyExpression=headers['my-special-key']
```

Please note that we use the binding name `supplier-out-0` since that is our function name, please update accordingly.

Then, we use this new key when we produce the message.
