# How do I use native serializer and deserializer instead of message conversion done by Spring Cloud Stream?

## Problem Statement

Instead of using the message converters in Spring Cloud Stream, I want to use native Serializer and Deserializer in Kafka.
By default, Spring Cloud Stream takes care of this conversion using its internal built-in message converters.
How can I bypass this and delegate the responsibility to Kafka?

## Solution

This is really easy to do.

All you have to do is to provide the following property to enable native serialization.

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<binding-name>.producer.useNativeEncoding: true
```

Then, you need to also set the serailzers.
There are a couple of ways to do this.

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<binding-name>.producer.configurarion.key.serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<binding-name>.producer.configurarion.value.serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
```

or using the binder configuration.

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configurarion.key.serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configurarion.value.serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
```

When using the binder way, it is applied against all the bindings whereas setting them at the bindings are per binding.

On the deserializing side, you just need to provide the deserializers as configuration.

For example,

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<binding-name>.consumer.configurarion.key.deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<binding-name>.producer.configurarion.value.deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
```

You can also set them at the binder level.

There is an optional property that you can set to force native decoding.

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<binding-name>.consumer.useNativeDecoding: true
```

However, in the case of Kafka binder, this is unncessary, as by the time it reaches to the binder, Kafka already deserializes them using the configured deserializers.
